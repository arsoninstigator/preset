# custom presets, brushes & overlays
here's a collection of assets i built during arcade :
- presets that can be imported into __polarr__ (i use it on android / sometimes web) and then edited
- brushes that can be imported to ibis paint x (i use it on android)
- overlays and graphics can be imported to photoshop/polarr/ibis or other editing app

# #1 importing filter into polarr
- install polarr on mobile from the app store / google play store
- download the qr code of the specific preset (for example, from the folder within this repo) as an image file
- open an existing image or a sample photo on the app
- click on 'filters'
- select the import button
- import the image previously downloaded from github into the app
- apply the filter onto your desired image
- adjust if necessary (based on lighting, texture etc.)
- voila ! save your image and do the same thing over with videos
